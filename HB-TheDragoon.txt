Thank you to my wonderful D&D friends - Tony, Ryan, Richard, Sidney, and Andrew, in no particular order. I bother the hell out of them with this stuff and it would never get made if I couldn't bounce my ideas off of them and actually playtest it with them.

Thank you to my lovely girlfriend Rachel who took the time out to proofread this document and help me fix all my mistakes.

Thank you to reddit users dawnwaker, gnomeo67, and fractals_of-light for looking over this class and giving feedback.

# Dragoon
An amber stone sits in a basket of other trinkets at a bazaar, a seemingly worthless rock amongst pottery and jewelry, but as the goliath passes, it sparks to life in a brilliant flash. The stall owner started jumping with glee as he tries to sell the now magical stone, but it only seems to spring to life for the huge man.

An elven soldier defies the imaginable, and slays the dragon plaguing his nation. Tired and hungry, the man lifts his spear to return home, but the voice of the dragon calls out to him, and a green stone drifts into his hands.

A human in the midst of war and battle fights for his life. Constantly battered and bruised, he fears the end is near, but just as he is cut down, his father's old pendant springs to life and in a blaze enveloping his body, emerges donning striking red armor and wide spread wings.

All of these people have been chosen as part of their destiny to be a dragoon. They will become the weapons of fate, slated to serve a greater cosmic plan. They are soldiers and embrace combat to the end  with a prowess for almost dance-like fighting skills that lead to the build of their fighting spirit in a display of massive power. Dragoons may just be as old as the dragons themselves, though how they came to be is a mystery.

### Knights of Destiny
Dragoons are chosen by fate, and not by the wielders of the power. The soul of the dragon accepts their wielder as their master with or without their consent. Dragoons seem to be drawn to each other, to fulfill whatever purpose they are needed for.

### Spirit in Insanity
A dragoon is a weapon. The only way for a mortal to harness the energy of a dragoon is to raise their spirit into a form of battle insanity that they channel through manifesting magical armor and abilities. Regardless of the user's profession of life before they became a dragoon, they are now and forever will be combatants for fate.

### Creating a Dragoon
When creating a dragoon, your character's backstory is paramount. Dragoons are soldiers of fate, and combat runs through their blood. They exist solely to be the will of destiny and are bound by its chains. How did they learn basic combat? Were they soldiers, taught for war? Taught through necessity in horrible conditions? How your character learned to fight goes a  long way to figuring out how your character came into being a dragoon.

Having possession of a dragoon spirit is no easy feat. Think about how your character could have obtained this, either prior to its activation or even after knowing what it is. Was the spirit a family heirloom in a pendant? Were they privy to a moment that a dragon was slain and they were chosen by the dragon's soul? Did they end a wicked dragoon's reign - or did they pry it from the rigteous' cold, dead hand.

```

#### Quick Build
You can make a dragoon quick by following these suggestions. First, make Strength or Dexterity your highest ability score, depending on whether you want to focus on melee weapons or on archery (or finesse weapons). Your next-highest score should be Wisdom. Second, choose the soldier background.


\page

<div class='pageNumber'>3</div>

## Class Features
As a dragoon, you gain the following class features
#### Hit Points
___
- **Hit Dice:** 1d10 per dragoon level
- **Hit Points at 1st Level:** 10 + your Constitution modifier
- **Hit Points at Higher Levels:** 1d10 (or 6) + your Constitution modifier per dragoon level after 1st

#### Proficiencies
___
- **Armor:** All armor, shields
- **Weapons:** Simple weapons, martial weapons
- **Tools:** None

___
- **Saving Throws:** Strength, Dexterity
- **Skills:** Choose two from Arcana, Acrobatics, Animal Handling, Athletics, History, Insight, Perception, Persuation, and Survival

#### Equipment
You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:
- (a) Scale Mail or (b) leather armor, Longbow, and 20 Arrows
- (a) a martial weapon and a Shield or (b) two martial Weapons
- (a) five javelins or (b) any simple weapon
- (a) a Dungeoneer's Pack or (b) an Explorer's Pack


### Fighting Style

You adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can’t take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.

#### Archery
You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons.

#### Dueling
When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.

#### Great Weapon Fighting
When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2. The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit.


#### Two-Weapon Fighting
When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack.

```
```

#### Brawling
You gain the following benefits while you are unarmed:
- You can use Dexterity instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of your unarmed strikes.
- You can roll a d4 in place of the normal damage of your unarmed strike.
- When you use the Attack action with an unarmed strike on your turn, you can make one unarmed strike as a bonus action.

### Spirit
Starting at 2nd level, when you successfully hit with a weapon attack, you generate one spirit point. You may have a maximum amount of spirit points accumulated at one time as shown on The Dragoon table. When you spend a hit die to recover HP, you may expend your current spirit points to instantly regain that much HP.

### Guard
Also at 2nd level, when you are the target of a weapon attack, you may spend two spirit points as a reaction to take a last minute fortified stance. While guarded, you gain resistance to all non-magical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage. This stance lasts until your next turn. Your next action may only be taken to expend one hit dice to heal.

### Dragoon Form
At 3rd level, the Dragoon Spirit, held in a colored stone that your character obtains, finds you worthy and brightly activates. As a bonus action, if you have a minimum of 5 spirit points stored, you may activate the dragoon form, projecting the soul of the dragon as a set of armor and wings. This form lasts for 1 minute, or until your spirit point count is 0, at which point you return to normal and your spirit point count turns to 0 regardless of whether it was used or not.

Your Dragoon Spirit may not be destroyed. If the stone is lost or stolen, you always know how far it is from you and the direction toward it. Another creature may not receive the benefits of the Dragoon Form or Dragoon Spirit unless the dragon's soul finds them worthy, at which point the original Dragoon must regain the trust and worth of the dragon. If two Dragoon Spirits are within 60 feet of each other, they shine brightly like beacons.

___
While in Dragoon Form, you gain the following benefits:

 - You gain a +2 bonus to your AC with your dragoon armor.
 - You gain a fly speed of 30 feet, with hover.
 - Your weapon gains a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls.
 
 ___
 Any action other than movement, dash, or disengage taken while in Dragoon Form costs 1 spirit point to perform. Every separate attack that would be made also costs 1 spirit point to perform. You do not gain any spirit points while in this form.

\page

<div class='pageNumber'>4</div>

### Dragoon Spirit
The spirit that is activated at 3rd level is the cause of a dragon's soul inside of a colored stone. The type of dragon that is within the spirit dictates extra abilities that you receive as you gain dragoon levels. Choose Red-Eyed, Jade, White-Silver, Dark, Violet, Blue-Sea, or Golden dragoon spirits, all detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 10th, 15th, and 18th level.

### Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to take a feat of your choice instead.

### Addition
Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn. If all attacks hit during an addition, you receive 1 extra spirit point per extra attack.

The number of attacks increases to three when you reach 11th level in this class.

### Draconic Connection
As a result of being bound to the soul of a dragon, at 6th level you begin to understand these creatures more. You have advantage on Wisdom (Survival) check to track dragons. 

In addition, once per long rest you may raise your Dragoon Spirit high above you. If there is a dragon within one mile of you, the stone shines bright and you know which direction the dragon is in.

### Fighting Style Upgrade
When you reach 9th level, your prowess in combat shows. The fighting style you chose at first level of this class gains an upgrade.

#### Archery
Attacking at long range doesn't impose disadvantage on your ranged weapon attack rolls.

#### Dueling
When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons or shield, you gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls with that weapon.

#### Great Weapon Fighting
Before you make a melee attack with a heavy weapon that you are proficient with, you can choose to take a -5 penalty to the attack roll. If the attack hits, you add +10 to the attack’s damage.

```
```

#### Two-Weapon Fighting
You can use two-weapon fighting even when the one-handed melee weapons you are wielding aren’t light.


#### Brawling
 - You can roll a d6 in place of the normal damage of your unarmed strike.
 - When you hit a creature with an unarmed strike on your turn, you can use a bonus action to attempt to grapple the target. A grapple check is a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the target's Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check.
 
### Magic Guard
At 13th level, when using the Guard feature, you gain resistance to all bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.

### Dragoon Addition
Upon reaching 14th level, when in Dragoon Form, your weapon is considered magical and gains a +2 bonus to attack and damage.

### Addition Plus
At 17th level, you may attack as many times as your Wisdom modifier whenever you take the Attack action on your turn. If you attack more than three times when using this feature, you do not add your ability modifier to any of these attack's damage.

If every attack hits while using this feature, you double the spirit points gained.

### Divine Dragoon Spirit
When reaching 20th level, you come into possession of a second Dragoon Spirit, one of a long forgotten non-elemental Divine Dragon. Speak to your GM about how you could possibly obtain this spirit, whether by slaying a dragon or having the trinket the whole time during your journey. When you enter Dragoon Form, you may instead choose to use this spirit instead of the one you chose earlier.

##### Divine Dragoon Form Spells
| Spell |Spirit Cost| Spell Level|
:-------------|:--:|:--:|
| Magic Missile | 3 |2nd|
| Protection from Energy | 7 |3rd|
| Resilient Sphere | 10 |4th|
| Disintegrate | 15 |6th|
| Illusory Dragon (Force) | 20 |8th|


#### Prismatic Armor
While in dragoon form, you become resistant to bludgeoning, piercing, slashing, and force damage. When using the Guard feature in Dragoon Form, you are immune to bludgeoning, piercing, slashing, and force damage.

  \page

<div class='pageNumber'>5</div>

#### Force Burst
When you complete every hit of an addition in Dragoon Form, you may spend two spirit points to unleash a torrent of force upon the last target you hit. The target takes an immediate extra 4d8 force damage.

  
## Dragoon Spirit
Every dragoon spirit is the soul of a departed dragon that lends its power to a worthy user. The soul of the dragon bestows different abilities depending on the type of dragon. Each Spirit description lists what D&D dragon soul fits best into it's lore.

#### Casting Spells

Dragoon spells bestowed by the dragon soul are themed by their element. Casting a leveled spell is done by spending spirit points while in Dragoon Form. If a spell allows you to cast it at a higher level, you may spend spirit points as if you were casting a higher level spell.

Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your dragoon spells, since your magic is born from your inner strength to evoke the dragon's power. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a dragoon spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

<div style="text-align: center">
**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier
</div>
