		<description>
			<p>An amber stone sits in a basket of other trinkets at a bazaar, a seemingly worthless rock amongst pottery and jewelry, but as the goliath passes, it sparks to life in a brilliant flash. The stall owner started jumping with glee as he tries to sell the now magical stone, but it only seems to spring to life for the huge man.</p>
			<p class="indent">An elven soldier defies the imaginable, and slays the dragon plaguing his nation. Tired and hungry, the man lifts his spear to return home, but the voice of the dragon calls out to him, and a green stone drifts into his hands.</p>
			<p class="indent">A human in the midst of war and battle fights for his life. Constantly battered and bruised, he fears the end is near, but just as he is cut down, his father's old pendant springs to life and in a blaze enveloping his body, emerges donning striking red armor and wide spread wings.</p>
			<p class="indent">All of these people have been chosen as part of their destiny to be a dragoon. They will become the weapons of fate, slated to serve a greater cosmic plan. They are soldiers and embrace combat to the end with a prowess for almost dance-like fighting skills that lead to the build of their fighting spirit in a display of massive power. Dragoons may just be as old as the dragons themselves, though how they came to be is a mystery.</p>
			<h4>KNIGHTS OF DESTINY</h4>
			<p>Dragoons are chosen by fate, and not by the wielders of the power. The soul of the dragon accepts their wielder as their master with or without their consent. Dragoons seem to be drawn to each other, to fulfill whatever purpose they are needed for.</p>
			<h4>SPIRIT IN INSANITY</h4>
			<p>A dragoon is a weapon. The only way for a mortal to harness the energy of a dragoon is to raise their spirit into a form of battle insanity that they channel through manifesting magical armor and abilities. Regardless of the user's profession of life before they became a dragoon, they are now and forever will be combatants for fate.</p>

			<h4>CREATING A DRAGOON</h4>
			<p>When creating a dragoon, your character's backstory is paramount. Dragoons are soldiers of fate, and combat runs through their blood. They exist solely to be the will of destiny and are bound by its chains. How did they learn basic combat? Were they soldiers, taught for war? Taught through necessity in horrible conditions? How your character learned to fight goes a long way to figuring out how your character came into being a dragoon.</p>
			<p class="indent">Having possession of a dragoon spirit is no easy feat. Think about how your character could have obtained this, either prior to its activation or even after knowing what it is. Was the spirit a family heirloom in a pendant? Were they privy to a moment that a dragon was slain and they were chosen by the dragon's soul? Did they end a wicked dragoon's reign - or did they pry it from the rigteous' cold, dead hand.</p>
			<h5>QUICK BUILD</h5>
			<p>You can make a dragoon quick by following these suggestions. First, make Strength or Dexterity your highest ability score, depending on whether you want to focus on melee weapons or on archery (or finesse weapons). Your next-highest score should be Wisdom. Second, choose the soldier background.</p>
			<h3>CLASS FEATURES</h3>
			<p>As a dragoon, you gain the following class features</p>
			<h5>HIT POINTS</h5>

			<span class="emphasis">Hit Points at Higher Levels:</span>1d10 (or 6) + your Constitution modifier per dragoon level after 1st<br/>
			</p>

			<h5>Casting Spells</h5>
			<p>Dragoon spells bestowed by the dragon soul are themed by their element. Casting a leveled spell is done by spending spirit points while in Dragoon Form. If a spell allows you to cast it at a higher level, you may spend spirit points as if you were casting a higher level spell.</p>
			<p class="indent">Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your dragoon spells, since your magic is born from your inner strength to evoke the dragon's power. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a dragoon spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>

			<p>At 3rd level, the Dragoon Spirit, held in a colored stone that your character obtains, finds you worthy and brightly activates. As a bonus action, if you have a minimum of 5 spirit points stored, you may activate the dragoon form, projecting the soul of the dragon as a set of armor and wings. This form lasts for 1 minute, or until your spirit point count is 0, at which point you return to normal and your spirit point count turns to 0 regardless of whether it was used or not.</p>
			<p class="indent">Your Dragoon Spirit may not be destroyed. If the stone is lost or stolen, you always know how far it is from you and the direction toward it. Another creature may not receive the benefits of the Dragoon Form or Dragoon Spirit unless the dragon's soul finds them worthy, at which point the original Dragoon must regain the trust and worth of the dragon. If two Dragoon Spirits are within 60 feet of each other, they shine brightly like beacons.</p>
			<p class="indent">While in Dragoon Form, you gain the following benefits:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>You gain a +2 bonus to your AC with your dragoon armor.</li>
				<li>You gain a fly speed of 30 feet, with hover.</li>
				<li>Your weapon gains a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Any action other than movement, dash, or disengage taken while in Dragoon Form costs 1 spirit point to perform. Every separate attack that would be made also costs 1 spirit point to perform. You do not gain any spirit points while in this form.</p>
